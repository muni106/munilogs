## Whoami?
Hi, I'm Mounir Samite, a computer science engineering student at University of Bologna, in Italy.
I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree.
I love solving hard problems and turning them into simple, useful solutions. Building things, whether clean code or new ideas, keeps me excited. 
I enjoy changing abstract thoughts into real projects and keep challenging myself through constant learning and practice.

## Life style
I believe that excelling in any field requires strong mental health, which stems from a balanced lifestyle. 
That's why I prioritize healthy eating, regular workouts, writing, and staying socially connected, even while dedicating significant time to my passions.
This approach keeps me energized and focused, allowing me to tackle complex challenges with creativity and perseverance.
