## Whoami?
I'm a student that loves building things from scratch

## Life style
I believe that excelling in any field requires strong mental health, which stems from a balanced lifestyle. 
That's why I prioritize healthy eating, regular workouts, writing, and staying socially connected, even while dedicating significant time to my passions.
This approach keeps me energized and focused, allowing me to tackle complex challenges with creativity and perseverance.
