## whoami
I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Bologna (Cesena), but more than that, I’m just someone who is deeply curious about how things work under the hood.

I’ve never been a "ui guy", I don't really care how a button looks, I care about what happens in the milliseconds after you click it. My head is usually buried in virtualization, systems architecture, and infrastructures, the invisible parts of tech that actually keep the world running.

## beyond the screen 
- As a builder I don't just want to read books, I want to break things, put them back together, and hopefully make them faster.
- I value transparency, in code that means clean, honest architecture. In life, it means real relationships and direct conversations.
- I think a lot, philosophy helps me make sense of the world, while innovation keeps me excited about being in it.
- I believe in "Mente sana in corpore sano", from Latin, it means that to have a clear and functioning mind, it is also necessary to take care of one's body through physical activity and a healthy lifestyle, promoting total psychophysical balance.
