# Intro
Since i was a kid everyone suggested to me, as a study method, to read sections and then repeat them out loud. I always thought that was the only way to learn, and it was necessary to spend a lot of time. 
<br>
But what if that advice was actually holding us back?

# Doubts
When I was in highschool I started doubting this learning method, some questions popped in my mind like: why should I spend a lot of time learning something that I will forget in probably a week? how can I spend less time?
A lot of friends of mine had to giveup on some activities, like sports or music, to keep up with their studies, in **HIGHSCHOL**, which for me was never an option.
Those extra activities are what define you, what I learnt with basketball and theater, will always be a part of me, and It helped me in **a lot** of situations.
