## Table of contents

# Intro
Since i was a kid everyone suggested to me, as a study method, to read sections and then repeat them out loud. I always thought that was the only way to learn, and it was necessary to spend a lot of time.

But what if that advice was actually holding us back?

# My story
From when i was in elementary school I thought it was normal to forget things you learn after an examination.
I crammed, resulting in kinda good performances in examinations, but always not remembering 80/90% of what I learnt.
I didn't enjoy learning at all, it had no purpose if not getting high grades, then I decided to study the minimum to pass.

When I passed the entrance exam for university something changes, I started thinking about why I decided to study computer science in a university, and I didn't want to forget everything I was learning, then I decided to study how to study.
